git commit

git branch

git checkout

git pull
- A combination of 'git fetch' and 'git merge'. For example, if you are on the main
  branch, and you 'git fetch' new commits, then the origin/main branch is updated.
  Then you call 'git merge origin/main' FROM the main branch, in order to update
  the *local branch* main.

git push

git merge

git rebase
- Basically, if you are on C1 (commit C1), which is where b1 (a branch tag)
  is pointing to, and there exists another branch branch b2 somewhere, 
  (I assume anywhere?), then the command 'git rebase b2' will (I think)
  *copy* the tree with root at C1 to the end of b2.

git fetch
- Will download any commits from the remote repository, and it will update
  the *remote branches* (that are on my LOCAL machine).
  It will NOT update the *local branches* in my repository!
