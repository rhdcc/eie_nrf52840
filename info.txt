This is a file consisting of interesting problems I've encountered
in this lesson.

I created a script `listen.sh` to start picocom
listening on port /dev/tty***, whichever one shows up.
(I use the `diff` command on the dev/ directory to
figure out which port I should connect to).

When I run this script, picocom says that it cannot
open the port and spits out a 'permission denied' error.

I temporarily bypass this by simpley running ./listen under sudo,
but this certainly is not a long term solution.

So in the future, I should determing what permissions I need to do
this, without giving picocom too many permissions.
